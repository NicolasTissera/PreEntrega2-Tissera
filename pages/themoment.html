                <div class="parrafos4"><p>2017/2021: Career beginnings
             In November 2014 she uploaded "Die Young", an original song, to YouTube under the name Kayleigh Rose. She wrote the song while at a summer camp at Interlochen Center for the Arts, which she said "changed [her] trajectory forever". She subsequently traveled to New York for several musical showcases, leading to her signing with music label Atlantic Records on May 8, 2015.She then adopted the stage name Chappell Roan in honor of her grandfather Dennis K. Chappell, who died of brain cancer in 2016; his favorite song was "The Strawberry Roan" by Curley Fletcher.She has also expressed dislike for her birth name.
        
             On August 3, 2017, Roan released her first single, "Good Hurt". The song was reviewed favorably in Interview, which praised her "striking maturity and surprisingly deep vocals." On September 22, 2017, she released an EP titled School Nights through Atlantic Records. Also in 2017, she supported Vance Joy on his Lay It On Me Tour. During this time, Roan lived with her parents in Springfield, Missouri, flying with them to Los Angeles or New York City when necessary. In 2018, Roan moved to Los Angeles. She has since stated this was the first time she felt able to live openly as a queer woman, as well as feeling "overwhelmed with complete love and acceptance", allowing her to begin "writing songs as the real [her]". From January to March 2018, she toured the United States with Declan McKenna.
        
             Roan began working with songwriter and producer Dan Nigro in early 2020. In April 2020, Roan released "Pink Pony Club", which she has described as a "hard left turn" from School Nights. The single was produced by Nigro, and its music video was directed by Griffin Stoddard. Roan has cited a visit to The Abbey, a gay bar in West Hollywood, as the inspiration for the song. She said that the song expressed her desire to become a go-go dancer in Los Angeles, stating, "truthfully, I'm not confident enough to do that, so I wrote a song about it."</p>

             <div><p class="parrafos4">Roan released two more singles, "Love Me Anyway" and "California", in May 2020. However, her releases were not profitable enough for Atlantic, who dropped Roan from the label in August 2020. Her boyfriend of four years broke up with her the same week, and she spent the next two years working as a production assistant as well as a barista and nanny to support herself. Despite this, USA Today ranked "Pink Pony Club" third on a list of the "10 best songs of 2020"; an accompanying description characterized it as dance-pop that "earnestly [celebrates] queer culture, acceptance and chasing your dreams". A year after its release, Vulture described "Pink Pony Club" as "the Song of Summer 2021", calling it a "synthy infectious bangarang". By August 2022, the song had been streamed more than 10 million times on Spotify.
             In early 2021, the success of Olivia Rodrigo's "Drivers License" shifted Nigro's focus from Roan as he worked on Sour with Rodrigo; Roan was unable to find a collaborator whom she liked as much. She briefly moved back to Missouri to work on her music independently while working in a drive-through.</p> </div>

                2022–23: The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.
                Roan had moved back to Los Angeles in October 2020 to continue working on her music independently while working a series of odd jobs, including as a production assistant and working in a donut shop. She then earned a publishing deal with Sony, and by March 2022, was able to work with Dan Nigro again to create and release "Naked in Manhattan." The song was her first release in two years, her first as an independent artist, and her first to express same-gender attraction. It was described by NPR as a "queer girl bop" with lyrics that are "tender, nostalgic" and "flirty yet uncertain". Roan also was selected as the opening act for Olivia Rodrigo for performances on Rodrigo's Sour Tour and for Fletcher on her Girl of My Dreams Tour.

                In August 2022, she released a second independent single, "Femininomenon". Earmilk described the song as "so fun and loud but so intricate" and noted it was different from Roan's past releases. Roan stated that the song, which was produced by Dan Nigro, was an attempt to "get away with being as ridiculous as I possibly can." An accompanying self-directed music video featured Roan riding a dirt bike. Roan released another single, "Casual", in October 2022, which she had begun working on with Dan Nigro in 2020.In March, 2023, Roan released "Casual", followed later that year with the release of subsequent singles "Kaleidoscope", "Red Wine Supernova" and "Hot to Go!".

                On September 22, 2023, Roan released her debut full-length album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, and began her second headlining tour, the Midwest Princess Tour. The tour, ending in the spring of 2024, traveled across North America and had shows in London, Paris, Berlin, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, and Amsterdam. Roan donated $1 per ticket sold to the nonprofit For the Gworls and opened each show with drag performers. The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess was included in several best-albums-of-2023 year-end lists.</p></div>
            <div><p class="parrafos4">
                Roan opened for Olivia Rodrigo's Guts World Tour in the United States and Canada from February to April 2024. In Roan's first week of the tour, her streams rose by 32%. Also in February, Roan was a musical guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. In March, NPR Music released Roan's Tiny Desk Concert performance.

                On April 5, 2024, Roan released the single "Good Luck, Babe!", described as "the first song of the next chapter". The song speaks about compulsory heterosexuality, describing a woman trying to deny her romantic feelings for Roan and women in general. Praised by Billboard as a "well-deserved breakthrough", the song received 7 million streams in its first week, was listed in the Spotify Top 10, and debuted at number 77 on the Billboard Hot 100. Later in the month, Roan performed at Coachella.At this time, Roan saw growing success on Spotify, with several of her songs listed on its Daily Top Songs USA chart, and her monthly listeners increasing more than 500% from February to April. As reported by Billboard, Roan's weekly streams grew more than 20 times greater in June 2024 than they were at the start of year. With the track, Roan earned her fastest song to hit 100 million streams on the platform. In June, the song became Roan's first top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, charting at number 16. It later hit the top 10 at number 10 on the chart in July, becoming her highest charting track and marking a 342% increase in total sales in the U.S.

                In June 2024, Roan's debut album entered the top ten on the Billboard 200 for the first time at number ten, with over 40,000 equivalent album units earned.The album also reached the top ten of Billboard's Top Album Sales chart for the first time at number eight, making it the album's best sales week yet, up 168%. The album went on to reach a peak of number five.In the week ending June 20, the album earned more than five times the units it was earning each week at the beginning of April.

                That same month, Roan revealed she had declined an invitation from the White House to perform for that year's Pride celebration. During the Governors Ball Music Festival, Roan stated "we want liberty, justice and freedom for all. When you do that, that's when I'll come", citing the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and transgender rights.

                Roan debuted an unreleased song titled "Subway" as part of her performance at the Governors Ball Music Festival in June 2024, continuing to work towards a new album.After drawing a crowd of more than 40,000 at the Boston Calling Music Festival and one of the biggest crowds at the Governors Ball Music Festival, the Bonnaroo Music Festival announced they were moving Roan's set from a small tent to a larger stage to cope with the demand.At her concert in Raleigh, North Carolina in June 2024, Roan spoke to the crowd about dealing with her rapid increase in popularity, stating "I think my career is just kind of going really fast and it's really hard to keep up. I'm just being honest, I'm having a hard time today. [...] This is all I've ever wanted — it's just heavy sometimes."</p></div> </h3>
