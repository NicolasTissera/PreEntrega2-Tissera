                 <div> <p class="parrafos4">Chappell Roan writes most of her songs by herself but has co-written some with other songwriters.After the release of her debut single "Good Hurt", her style was described in Interview as "pop sound [...] infused with a dark and unsettling tone that underscores her intense, somber lyrics." In 2018, she described her musical style as a mix of organic and electronic sounds, with a pop tone, and as "dark pop with ballad undertones." In her songs written while she was a teenager, according to Atwood Magazine, she "brought the hardship and turbulence of our teenaged years to life with a candidness and vividness seldom seen from her peers." Roan describes her music as "kind of the fairytale version of what happened in real life" as her persona is a larger-than-life version of her real self. Roan has been described as having a soprano vocal range</p>

        <h2 class="titulos">Insipiration</h2>
            <div><h3>
                <p class="parrafos4">Roan has cited Kate Bush as a prominent influence. She has also cited inspirations including the artist Abbey Watkins, the film The Beguiled, and musical artists alt-J, Stevie Nicks, Lorde, and Lana Del Rey. A 2017 review of her debut EP in PopCrush compared her sound to the latter two artists. She has stated that the song "Stay" by Rihanna inspired her to begin writing music. In 2023, a Variety article described Roan as "glammy and pop and embracing her femininity and shared Gen-Z generational experiences, and also very queer-positive." Roan has also cited Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj as inspiration for her attitude towards making people feel confident with her music.Discovering artists like Katy Perry, Kesha, Britney Spears, and Pink during her adolescence also influenced her to start writing music and construct her onstage persona. Roan stated she was raised on Christian rock during her childhood but never identified with it, instead having a curiosity about pop music.
            
                Roan's makeup and hair is primarily inspired by drag makeup, including queens like Violet Chachki. Roan's makeup also takes inspiration from Boy George, '80s punk and Vivienne Westwood. Roan described her makeup looks for the Coachella festival as "Paris Hilton and James St. James or Walt Cassidy became one and put on a drag show." Roan is also heavily inspired by the Club Kids scene. While on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Roan stated her stage looks reference horror movies, burlesque, and theater. Roan also described her outlook for her on-stage costumes, "I love looking pretty and scary. Or, like, pretty and tacky. Or just not pretty. I love that too. I just think it's just not serious, I love that fans find such deep meanings to things and I'm just like, 'I don't know, I thought I looked hot.' Like, I don't know if it's anything more than that." Roan considers herself as a drag queen with her own persona, stating, "I've never fully understood why women shouldn't be allowed to do drag because – yes, I do drag! [...] It feels like they don't like women doing certain things. Another man trying to tell a woman what to do. Just try telling me what to do! I'm a drag queen – whether you like it when women do it or not."</p>

        <h2 class="titulos">Culture Impact</h2>
            <div><h3>
                <p class="parrafos4">Roan's success has led her to be called a "queer pop icon", "a superstar in the making", and a "visionary performer".Roan has been credited with leading a "lesbian pop renaissance" on the music charts and within the cultural zeitgeist. Roan's music brought the concept of compulsory heterosexuality into the forefront of mainstream pop music. She has been praised for her "unapologetic authenticity" and "expression of her queerness and femininity" in her music and live performances, inspiring young women to embrace their own sexuality. She has also been applauded for her image "rejecting the male gaze" within the pop landscape. Roan has been praised for her "punkish" attitude towards the status quo for queer performers and applauded for "rewriting the rules of lovelorn pop." Rolling Stone described watching Roan's performances as "like watching Michelangelo craft the statue of David in real time."

                Roan has received praise from within the music industry. Elton John invited Roan to join his Rocket Hour podcast and stated about her success, "It's wonderful to see true talent being recognized." Roan was Olivia Rodrigo's top artist on her Spotify Wrapped for 2023, and Roan features background vocals on three tracks of Rodrigo's, including her album Guts and The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes soundtrack. Lady Gaga commented "I love Chappell" under a TikTok video of Roan covering her song "Bad Romance" while on tour. Ariana Grande stated "I really love Chappell Roan" in an Instagram post sharing a viral Wicked meme of Roan's Statue of Liberty costume at the Governors Ball Music Festival. In June 2024, Sabrina Carpenter covered "Good Luck, Babe!" on Radio 1's Live Lounge, having expressed her admiration for Roan's work.
            
                In 2024, Roan gave a guest lecture at the Harvard Medical School. When searching for Roan's name on Google, users are prompted with "Did you mean: your favorite artist's favorite artist", which references a viral clip of Roan introducing herself on stage at the Coachella Music Festival. This was inspired by Roan's favorite drag performer Sasha Colby. Roan joked the search term was caused by a "random twink who works at Google" and stated that she modified Colby's phrase as she hoped Colby would one day watch and recognize her</p>
